It looks like you already have a `greet()` endpoint defined in **app/main.py**. Here’s the relevant snippet:

```python
@app.get("/greet")
def greet(name: str = "world"):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}
```
【F:app/main.py†L13-L15】

No further edits are needed to add this function. If you meant to add `greet()` to a different `main.py` (e.g. at the project root or elsewhere), just let me know where, and I’ll make the change there!
