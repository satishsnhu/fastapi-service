It looks like you already have a `greet()` endpoint defined in **app/main.py**:

```python
@app.get("/greet")
def greet(name: str = "world"):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}
```
【F:app/main.py†L13-L15】

No further edits are needed. If you intended to add a different `greet()` (e.g. in another file or with different behavior), just let me know where and what you’d like it to do!
