It looks like you already have a `greet()` endpoint defined in **app/main.py**:

```python
@app.get("/greet")
def greet(name: str = "world"):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}
```
【F:app/main.py†L13-L15】

So no further edits are required to add this function. If you intended to add a different `greet()` (for example, in a different `main.py` at the project root), just let me know where and I’ll make that change.
